# Content Classification Portal

A high-performance, modular Streamlit web application designed to evaluate and classify textual comments and visual media for multi-label toxicity detection. The system seamlessly bridges computer vision (BLIP image captioning) with deep learning natural language processing (PyTorch LSTM).

## Interface Preview

### Evaluation Workspace

The primary workspace allows users to input text comments or upload images for instant multi-label toxicity analysis.

### System Audit History

The audit view provides comprehensive tracking, performance metrics, and record management for all past submissions.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Mode Processing**: Evaluate direct text comments or upload images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) that are automatically captioned before classification.

- **Multi-Label Toxicity Detection**: Identifies categories including toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity_hate.

- **Persistent Audit Logs**: Automatically records submissions, predictions, and timestamps with full management controls to delete past entries.

- **Optimized Local Inference**: Implements efficient tensor caching and `torch.inference_mode()` for fast, responsive execution on CPU.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanGaber528/Cellula_2Week_Abdelrahman_Gaber.git
   cd Cellula_2Week_Abdelrahman_Gaber
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Model Assets**:

   Ensure your `assets/` folder contains your trained weights (`lstm_weights.pt`), configuration (`config.json`), and vocabulary (`vocab.json`).

## How to Run and Use the App

### Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit web server from your project root directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will automatically open the interactive web portal in your default browser.

### Using the Portal

1. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar radio buttons to switch between the **Evaluation Workspace** and **History Logs**.

2. **Evaluation Workspace**:

   - Type a comment into the chat input bar or upload an image using the file uploader.
   - View the real-time classification results and generated caption badges instantly.

3. **History Logs**:

   - Navigate to the audit view to review total submission metrics and detailed past evaluations.
   - Use the **Delete** button next to any record to remove it from the persistent log.
